# Mini Zelda Game

## Introduction
Welcome to Mini Zelda, the first implementation of my indie game development journey. As a Product Manager with a passion for coding, I’ve created this project for fun and as a stepping stone to building my own indie game. It’s been a while since I last coded, but this adventure has been an exciting way to reignite my love for programming and game development.

## Summary of the Game
Mini Zelda is a lightweight 2D game inspired by classic RPGs. Players control a small Zelda-like character to explore a pixel-art world, face an enemy, and interact with the game’s mechanics, including movement, shooting arrows, and collision detection. While simple, this game is packed with charm and serves as a foundation for my future indie game projects.

## Features
- <strong>Sprite-Based Movement</strong>: Navigate the game world using sprite animations for character movement.
- <strong>Arrow Shooting Mechanic</strong>: Fire arrows dynamically in four directions (left, right, up, and down).
- <strong>Enemy Interaction</strong>: Encounter enemies and engage with game elements like walls and obstacles.
- <strong>Pixel-Art Design</strong>: Enjoy nostalgic visuals through handcrafted sprites and pixel-art aesthetics.
