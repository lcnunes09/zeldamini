# Mini Zelda Game

## Introduction
Welcome to Mini Zelda, the first implementation of my indie game development journey. As a Product Manager with a passion for coding, I’ve created this project for fun and as a stepping stone to building my own indie game. It’s been a while since I last coded, but this adventure has been an exciting way to reignite my love for programming and game development.

## Summary of the Game
Mini Zelda is a lightweight 2D game inspired by classic RPGs. Players control a small Zelda-like character to explore a pixel-art world, face an enemy, and interact with the game’s mechanics, including movement, shooting arrows, and collision detection. While simple, this game is packed with charm and serves as a foundation for my future indie game projects.

## Features
- <strong>Sprite-Based Movement</strong>: Navigate the game world using sprite animations for character movement.
- <strong>Arrow Shooting Mechanic</strong>: Fire arrows dynamically in four directions (left, right, up, and down).
- <strong>Enemy Interaction</strong>: Encounter enemies and engage with game elements like walls and obstacles.
- <strong>Pixel-Art Design</strong>: Enjoy nostalgic visuals through handcrafted sprites and pixel-art aesthetics.

## Planned Features

Here are the next features I plan to implement as I continue developing **Mini Zelda**:

- **Player Mechanics**:
  - Add a **life system** for the player, allowing them to take damage from enemies.
  - Enable the player to hurt enemies through attacks.
  - Trigger a **Game Over screen** when the player's life reaches zero.

- **Enemy Mechanics**:
  - Introduce a **life system** for enemies, making them defeatable.
  - Allow enemies to randomly **block player attacks**.
  - Trigger a **Player Victory screen** when all enemies are defeated.

- **Dynamic Gameplay**:
  - Spawn **new enemies randomly** after a certain period to increase difficulty.
  - Generate **additional blocks** randomly to add environmental challenges.

These features aim to bring more depth and excitement to Mini Zelda, paving the way for a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience. Feedback or suggestions for these features are welcome—feel free to contribute!
